# 3D Bakery Shop using Three.js
This is built with Three.js, a special tool for building interactive 3D experiences on the web.
Imagine stepping into a virtual bakery, surrounded by the warm glow of ovens and the enticing aroma of fresh bread. This captivating experience can be a reality for your customers with the power of 3D e-commerce. Unlike traditional websites with static images, 3D environments allow users to explore your bakery from any angle, fostering a deeper connection with your products.
## Features
The Foundation: Scene, Camera, and Lighting
The scene acts as the virtual canvas where the bakery shop will come to life. Next, the camera acts like the user's eye, defining their perspective within the scene positioned  slightly above eye level for a natural viewing experience.
A. Floor and Walls
The foundation of the bakery starts with the floor and walls. Planes are used as basic 3D shapes and textures are incorporated for a realistic touch.

B. Shelves and Display Cases
Various shapes are utilized to create shelves and display cases
Wooden Shelves: Simple boxes can effectively represent wooden shelves.
Rolling Display Case: Cylinders are perfect for creating a rolling display case.
Glass Display Case: Planes with transparency create a realistic glass effect for showcasing pastries.
